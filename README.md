# Starter Project Deployment

Welcome to the **Starter Project Deployment** repository! This project is a simple web application designed to demonstrate basic functionalities with React on the frontend and Web3 with Ethers.js for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. 

## Features

- **Return Owner Address**: A function to retrieve the address of the contract owner.
- **Transfer Funds**: A function to transfer funds to a specified recipient address.

## Introduction

This project serves as a starter template for deploying a React application that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain using Web3 and Ethers.js. It includes basic functions to return the owner's address and transfer funds between addresses.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Web3**: JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Ethers.js**: A library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem.
- **Solidity**: Programming language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later) or yarn (v1.x or later)
- MetaMask or any Ethereum wallet for interacting with the smart contract

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/starter-project-deployment.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd starter-project-deployment
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```
   This will launch the application on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Deploy the smart contract:**

   Ensure you have a local Ethereum blockchain running (e.g., using Ganache) or connect to a testnet/mainnet.

   Deploy your smart contract using a tool like Truffle or Hardhat. Update the contract address and ABI in your React app accordingly.

3. **Interact with the smart contract:**

   Use the provided functions in the React app to interact with the deployed smart contract.

## Smart Contract Functions

### Return Owner Address

A function to return the address of the contract owner.

```javascript
async function getOwnerAddress() {
  const ownerAddress = await contract.owner();
  console.log("Owner Address:", ownerAddress);
  return ownerAddress;
}
```

### Transfer Funds

A function to transfer funds to a recipient address.

```javascript
async function transferFunds(recipient, amount) {
  const tx = await contract.transfer(recipient, ethers.utils.parseEther(amount));
  await tx.wait();
  console.log(`Transferred ${amount} ETH to ${recipient}`);
}
```
